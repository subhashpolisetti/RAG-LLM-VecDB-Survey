# **When Large Language Models Meet Vector Databases: Synergy for Advanced AI**

This repository explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vector Databases (VecDBs) work together, based on insights from the referenced survey paper. It focuses on showing how their combination can solve practical problems, like improving how AI retrieves and uses information (retrieval-augmented generation) and building more efficient systems for real-world applications.

## **Overview**

LLMs are transformative in NLP but face critical limitations:
- **Hallucinations**: Generating plausible but incorrect responses.
- **Outdated Knowledge**: Static knowledge models require constant updates.
- **High Costs**: Training and API usage are expensive.
- **Memory Issues**: Difficulty retaining context over long conversations.

VecDBs address these issues by:
- Providing **efficient knowledge retrieval** and storage.
- Acting as a **cost-effective memory** layer.
- Enhancing real-time **domain-specific insights**.

This repository includes:
1. A **Medium article** summarizing findings from the research paper.
2. A **slide deck** highlighting architectural insights and practical applications.
3. A **video presentation** explaining the project end-to-end.
